#+TITLE: Property Base Your State Machine
#+AUTHOR: Sean Chalmers, Jack Kelly
#+EMAIL:

* Programs are weird
  Complex, Dependent, Interactive, Insidious

* Testing weird is hard
  - manual testing? [cries in Quality Assurance]
  - which processes do you test?
  - test for failure?

* Cost : Benefit
  - multi-step testing can be arduous and brittle
    - input and process are static
    - coverage
    - new feature? have fun!

* Do what we can
  - write unit tests
  #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
    funcB "fred"  == TunaSalad
    funcB "sally" == HalfChicken ExtraHot
  #+END_SRC
  - subcontract end users to suggest regression tests

* Property-based testing
  - randomised input generation: ~generateText~
  - shrinking
  - awesome design tool: ~generateUsername~

* Property-based state machine testing
  Property-based testing, lifted to the level of *application behaviour*.
  
** Generate structured inputs
   randomised inputs for actions

** Generate workflows
   define actions independently, let the package generate workflows

** Shrinking (OMG!)
   you thought shrinking was cool before...

** Useful feedback
   a failure will produce:
   - list of actions
   - their respective inputs
   - the random seed responsible

* OMG
  Right?

* Moving parts

** Model
   track expectations/awareness regarding the 'state' of the world

** Command
   - pre & post conditions
   - input generator
   - action executor
   - model update function
   Represents the /transitions/ not the states.

** Given
   [[./images/mach.png]]

** Test this
   [[./images/mach_transitions.png]]

** Not this
   [[./images/mach_states.png]]

* Machines that grow
  new feature ~ new Command(s)

* Some cool examples
  - wordpress API (tiny bit of it)
  - levelDB

* Come to the workshop!
  Learn the weirding way!

* Bonus Round
 Use classification to understand your test-case distribution
