----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- This module contains an example of an alternative technique for        --
-- testing structures and simple actions. There are no exercises here. :) --
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Sometimes when testing a given thing, you may be able to use
-- existing data structures or functions as a reference for your
-- implementation. In this case it may be useful to create a mini-DSL
-- that you can evaluate using the thing under test, or using the
-- reference implementation. Comparing the results of the evaluations
-- will be the test.

-- We will use the insert and delete actions for MyBTree to demonstrate this.

-- Use a data structure to represent the actions.
data Model k v
  = Insert k v (Model k v)      -- Inserting a value 'v' at key 'k'
  | Delete k (Model k v)        -- Deleting the key and value at 'k'
  | EmptyModel                  -- No action
  deriving (Show, Eq)

-- We need to evalute our DSL using 'MyBTree'
eval :: Ord k => Model k v -> MyBTree k v
eval (Insert k v m) = insert k v $ eval m
eval (Delete k m) = deleteKey k $ eval m
eval EmptyModel = Empty

-- We also need to be able to evaluate the actions against a
-- reference. For this we will use the 'Map' type from the
-- 'containers' package.
model :: Ord k => Model k v -> Map k v
model (Insert k v m) = Map.insert k v $ model m
model (Delete k m) = Map.delete k $ model m
model EmptyModel = Map.empty

-- We can then write a general property that can accept a 'Model',
-- evaluates the DSL against our thing being tested as well as the
-- reference and ensures that they should produce the same output,
-- when reduced to a suitable comparison type. In this case, an
-- ascending list.
prop_mybtree :: (Monad m, Show k, Show v, Eq v, Ord k) => Model k v -> PropertyT m ()
prop_mybtree m = toListWithKey (eval m) === Map.toAscList (model m)

-- This DSL now gives us the flexiblity to test our structure against
-- various implementations in different situations without having to
-- necessarily duplicate a lot of code. Additionally it is trivial to
-- write 'unit tests' that use this DSL, but we've also now created
-- the possibility of writing a generator for our DSL. Thus we can
-- lean on Hedgehog to generate sequences of actions.

-- Some unit tests
prop_single_insert :: Property
prop_single_insert = withTests 1 . property . prop_mybtree $
  Insert 1 'a' EmptyModel

prop_single_delete :: Property
prop_single_delete = withTests 1 . property . prop_mybtree $
  Delete 1 (Insert 1 'a' EmptyModel)

-- These unit tests leave something to be desired but hopefully they
-- serve as a sufficient demonstration of the point. Namely, they lack
-- coverage.

-- About that generator...
--
-- Our model is a recursive structure. Hedgehog provides functions to
-- manage recursive generators, lest they produce infinite structures by
-- accident. This also allows Hedgehog greater control of shrinking which
-- provides greater accuracy for us.
--
genModel :: (Show k, Show v, Eq v, Ord k, MonadGen m) => m k -> m v -> m (Model k v)
genModel genK genV = Gen.recursive Gen.choice
  -- Hedgehog shrinks towards the non-recursive base case(s)
  [ pure EmptyModel
  ]
  -- Create the subterms for our Model that separate the recursive component into a separate function.
  [ Gen.subtermM (genModel genK genV) (\m -> Insert <$> genK <*> genV <*> pure m)
  , Gen.subtermM (genModel genK genV) (\m -> Delete <$> genK <*> pure m)
  ]

-- Now we can write a more thorough test of our structure using the
-- generator that will provide far greater coverage.
prop_mybtree_gen_model :: Property
